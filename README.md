# Caesar-Cipher
> In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar‚Äôs cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar‚Äôs code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
This program takes in a string and a shift factor and then outputs the modified string
